%% @doc Deciding whether an answer is worth blocking.
%%
%% A condition is written in the shape of a served answer and keyed by the same
%% names the API uses, so what you write here reads like what you get back.
%% Atom and binary keys both work, which is what lets a condition come out of
%% `json:decode/1' on an app's config file as readily as out of source:
%%
%% ```
%% #{location => #{country => [<<"CU">>, <<"IR">>, <<"KP">>]}}
%% #{asn => #{type => <<"hosting">>}}
%% #{is_vpn => true, vpn => #{provider => <<"nordvpn">>}}
%% #{is_resproxy => true, resproxy => #{hits => #{gte => 5}}}
%% [#{is_hosting => true}, #{is_cdn => true}]   % a list is OR
%% '''
%%
%% A value may be a scalar (equality, strings without regard to case), a list
%% meaning any-of, a map of `gte'/`gt'/`lte'/`lt' bounding a number, or a nested
%% condition. A member set to `false', `null' or `undefined' is ignored entirely
%% - a condition states the positive signals you act on, so there is no way to
%% write "block when this is false", which would otherwise read as blocking
%% everybody.
%%
%% WRITE STRINGS AS BINARIES. An Erlang string is a list of codepoints, so
%% `"nordvpn"' and an any-of of those numbers are the same term and no library
%% can tell them apart. A bare string is accepted anyway - `io_lib' decides,
%% exactly as it does when printing - but that makes an any-of of small
%% printable integers unreachable. Binaries have no such ambiguity, and are what
%% `json:decode/1' produces.

%% @doc The members a condition names that this answer did not carry: a top-level
%% member, or a paid one inside an object every plan gets, by its path
%% (`location.city').
%%
%% A field your plan does not include is absent rather than false, so a condition
%% naming one can never match and the block would silently never fire. An empty
%% object is a real answer, meaning the flag above it is false, so nothing inside
%% one is reported: `vpn' present but `#{}' is not a plan gap. A populated object
%% carries every member the plan includes, so a member missing there is one.
%%
%% A locally answered bogon needs no special case: it is synthesized in the
%% widest shape, so every member is present and nothing reads as missing.
