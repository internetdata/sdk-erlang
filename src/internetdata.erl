%% Build a client once with {@link new/1}, pass the term around, and release it
%% with {@link close/1}. Every call answers `{ok, Term}' or `{error, Error}';
%% nothing here raises for a failure the API can report.
%%
%% <b>Absent is not false.</b> A lookup answer is a map whose plan-gated keys are
%% simply MISSING when your plan does not include them, which is a different
%% answer from the key being present and `false'. Use `maps:get(is_hosting,
%% Result, undefined)' or `maps:find(is_hosting, Result)' when the distinction
%% matters, and `maps:get(is_hosting, Result, false)' when it does not.
%%
%% Results are maps keyed by ATOMS for the fields the API documents, and by
%% BINARIES for anything the server names: the format keys under `schema',
%% `sample' and `size', the dataset column names inside a sample row, and an AS
%% answer's `whois'. See {@link internetdata_result} for why.

%% `api_key' is optional: without one a lookup is on Unlimited, the free plan,
%% answering `ip', `is_bogon', the Tor and relay members, InternetData's own
%% flags, `location', `asn', `company', `hostname' and `abuse' with no daily or
%% monthly cap. A batch needs a key on a paid plan, and the database endpoints a
%% key with the `db.download' scope. Without one no `authorization' header is
%% sent at all, and the `oauth_*' functions never send one. An empty or blank key
%% is no key, and so are `false', which is what
%% `os:getenv/1' answers for a variable that is not set, and `nil', Elixir's
%% `System.get_env/1' answer for one. The key is trimmed, so one read from a file
%% with its newline works; one still holding a control character raises
%% `{badarg, {api_key, control_character}}', naming the cause and not the key.
%%
%% `base_url' defaults to `https://api.internetdata.io', where every call but the
%% `oauth_*' ones goes. Those go to the apex it sits under, `api.' dropped and
%% `api-<env>.' becoming `<env>.', and to any other base URL as given.
%%
%% `timeout_ms' is milliseconds from 1 to 4294967295, or `infinity' for no bound,
%% `retries' an integer of 0 or more and `concurrency' an integer of 1 or more;
%% anything else raises `badarg' here rather than failing every call.
%%
%% The cache is per client and never shared, because two clients holding
%% different keys are on different plans and so entitled to different fields.
%% Unless `cache' is `false' this starts a process linked to the caller, which
%% ends when the caller does, so build clients somewhere long lived and `close/1'
%% them when you are done.

%%
%% Usage counts against the ALLOWANCE WINDOW - on a paid plan the anniversary

%% on. `hard_limit' is `null' when we never stop serving, which is not the

%%
%% Bogons are answered locally and cached answers are reused; everything else
%% goes to the batch endpoint in chunks of up to 1000 addresses, with at most
%% `concurrency' chunks in flight. Keyed by address rather than positional, so
%% duplicates in the input collapse to a single entry and the caller never has
%% to line two lists up. An address that fails carries its `{error, Error}' as
%% its value, so one bad entry cannot lose the rest of the answers: the API
%% reports a per-entry failure with the status the single lookup would have
%% answered, and a chunk that fails as a whole marks every address in it. The
%% batch endpoint needs a paid plan: without a key every address in a request of
%% two or more carries an `unauthorized' error, and a free-plan key's request of
%% two or more a `bad_request' (HTTP 402). A request of one address is answered
%% as its lookup would be.
%% Erlang maps have no insertion order, so the result is a set of keys rather
%% than a sequence. An address given as a tuple is keyed by its text.
